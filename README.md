## 🎨 Design Philosophy
This project explores **"Titanium & Neon Glass"** aesthetics—a 2025 design trend that combines metallic textures with vibrant digital accents. It moves away from standard layouts to a **Bento-Minimalism** approach, prioritizing scannability and visual storytelling.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Bento Grid Architecture:** A modular layout that organizes IT skills, projects, and personal branding into a cohesive dashboard.
* **Unique IT Animation:** A custom-coded "Data Stream" background that reacts to system logic, representing the "Digitalization" process.
* **Real-time KTM Sync:** A precision-engineered clock and status indicator synchronized to Kathmandu (NP) time, featuring day/night contextual logic.
* **Interactive Design Engine:** Magnetic hover effects and orbital animations representing the creative toolset (Figma, Canva, Linux).
* **Micro-Interactions:** Custom pulsing status indicators and a hidden "Snake" game engine for user engagement.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Design:** Figma, Canva (Prototyping & Layout)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Advanced Grid & Flexbox)
- **Logic:** JavaScript (ES6+, DOM Manipulation, Canvas API)
- **Styles:** Custom Titanium-Glassmorphism, Retro-futurism Typography
